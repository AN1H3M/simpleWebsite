            <p>I am an incoming Sophomore in Oregon State University. I’ve always interacted with coding languages and have periodically worked on small projects throughout my life. I’ve interacted with different languages and took classes to further my understanding and proficiency. I’m still a student and always will be so I’m always willing to learn new skills and new methods to be successful.</p>
